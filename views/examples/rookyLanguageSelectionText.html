The language chosen to write a chess engine such as this has a huge impact on its eventual performance. Because the primary method of computing the "best" move is through simple brute force, languages implemented with a compiler allow much more efficient execution, and thus a much deeper search.<br><br>That being said, I decided to write my bot entirely in in Ruby programming lanuage. I did this simply because I greatly enjoy coding in Ruby, and I wanted to learn more about the language. By the class tournament at the end of the term, I certainly had a greater appreciation for the difference in program speeds between compiled and interpreted programs.<br><br>Indeed, I did not fare terribly well in the contest.
