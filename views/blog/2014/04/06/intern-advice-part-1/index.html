<h2>The Intern Experience Catalog: Part I</h2>

  <p class='blogParagraph'>Back in the Summer of 2013, my fellow engineering intern at Puppet Labs, <a href='https://twitter.com/TheJusticarr'>Justin Carr</a>, had the excellent idea of documenting some of the lessons we had all collectively learned during our Summer internships for the sake of future interns. The following was my contribution to the catalog, somewhat edited to remove company specific stuff.</p><br>

  <h4>The Importance of Project Planning and Self Motivation</h4>
  <p class='blogParagraph'>As has been said before, the differences between the worlds of the University and the workplace can take some getting used to for a brand new intern. This contrast can be particularly pronounced in the area of time management.</p>

  <p class='blogParagraph'>As a student, your schedule is often determined by the rigid syllabi of three or more professors who dictate what you should be doing and when you should be doing it. The average assignment is usually a short-term engagement, lasting only a few days. Larger, self driven projects, while not entirely uncommon, are certainly not the core of the undergraduate curriculum.</p>

  <p class='blogParagraph'>As an engineering intern, you may find that you, as an individual, have become much more autonomous in your role and duties than you were at your University. Depending on your department and official Internship terms, you may very well be responsible for setting your own goals and weekly progress benchmarks. This means that you will need to find a way to create the same sort of time structure that you are comfortable with for yourself. This is where self-motivation comes in, as you will often need to drive yourself to create concrete enough goals to complete a task on time.</p>

  <p class='blogParagraph'>Itâ€™s important to note that this does not mean your experience will be completely unstructured. To the contrary, in my experience engineering departments utilize many tools to help teams and individuals pick and focus on individual tasks of the highest priority on a weekly basis. However, it will often be up to you to decide which tasks you will work on each week.</p>

  <p class='blogParagraph'>Finally, depending on what your role is as an intern, you may also be assigned an internship-long individual project. If this is the case, picking your goals and project milestones and properly planning your time is crucial to having a satisfying intern experience while also delivering an awesome product at the end of your time at your company. Creating a personal agenda with big-picture action items was invaluable for me as I set out on my project, and helped me to keep my team informed on both my long and short-term goals for the duration of my internship.</p>

  <p class='blogParagraph'>P.S: As another somewhat unrelated piece of advice, keep a written record of everything you learn during your internship! Make a point of writing something down each day that you learned or did successfully.</p>
