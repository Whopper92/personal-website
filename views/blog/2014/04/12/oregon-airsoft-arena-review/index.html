<p class='blogParagraph'>Back when I was in High School, one of my favorite things to do was spend weekends participating in Airsoft events, whether they be huge 400 person games like <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SQeHrGm6K8'>this legendary event held in Molalla</a> or 4 on 4 mini-matches with my friends in the woods behind one of our houses.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>I very recently started getting the itch to get back into the sport, and so I rejoined the excellent Pacific Northwest Airsoft community, <a href='http://airsoftpacific.com/'>Airsoft Pacific</a>. This community is large and quite mature, mainly featuring players of ages 18 and older. Through the site, large-scale events are organized every month of the year.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>Though Airsoft Pacific hosts games like these quite often, I found myself wishing for a way to play on weekends when no events were going on, while also minimizing the distance that I'd have to drive.</p>


<p class='blogParagraph'>My research to this effect led me to the website of <a href='http://oregon-airsoft.com/'>Oregon Airsoft Arena</a>. The arena features a large close-quarters-combat playfield and rentable weapons and gear. Being in Hillsboro, I decided to go ahead and make the drive out to give it a try!</p>


<p class='blogParagraph'>Upon arrival, I was immediately a bit put off by the relative lack of attention from the staff, whom I needed to help me get my personal gun measured for BB speed. I had to wave them down several times, and they weren't terribly responsive to my questions. This, however, can probably be attributed to the fact that other players were starting to show up for open hours and the store was getting busy.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>Once I got myself setup and registed for 3 hours of play time, I was directed to go back to the "green room" to prepare all of my gear. Now, this is where my biggest problem with Oregon Airsoft Arena lies.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>You see, at Airsoft Pacific events, you can expect to play with many individuals who are adults. As I wrote earlier, most members of the community are 18 years of age or older, so there is a certain sense of maturity present at events.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>This was NOT the case at the arena. Unfortunately, as I entered the green room I realized that I would be surrounded exclusively by High School aged kids, many of whom were rather loud and annoying. I had really hoped for a more mature crowd to show up, but I wasn't about to let my three hours of arena time go to waste, so I set out to play anyway.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>The arena itself is fairly nice, though I have several complaints about it. For one thing, it is quite dark in the playing area, making it very difficult to verify where your BB's are going. It was so dark that I had a hard time figuring out if my gun was even shooting, which hindered some of the fun until I more or less got the hang of it.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>Complaint number two was the foul odor that can be smelled at various points of the arena. It smells as if a septic line burst, or some similar, odoriferous catastrophy.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>That being said, there certainly was fun to be had during the short, 10 minute matches in the arena. Game types included team deathmatch, and several (more fun) objective based games like point security and attack and defend. I was able to get some good usage out of my guns and bag a couple of kills, which was quite fun.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>Despite the higher points of my time at the arena, I really had a hard time getting past the age demographic of the place. I felt quite out of place as the only obvious College student present. To be honest, I did sort of suspect this may be the case, but I decided to give it a try anyway.</p>

<p class='blogParagraph'>Overall, Oregon Airsoft Arena is not a bad place. If I were to bring along a group of my older friends to hang out with in the green room and during the matches, I'm sure I would have had a much better time. Yet, as it stands, I cannot recommend showing up solo as an older player unless you're alright with some awkwardness and annoying High School kids.</p>
