<div style="float:right;padding-left:20px;"><div class="thumbnail" style="float:right;padding-left:10px;padding-right:10px;"><img src="img/cleancode.jpg" align="right" height=300 width=220><div class="caption"><p class="text-muted"><i>Clean Code,</i> by Robert Martin</p></div></div></div>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe other day, I got to thinking about some of the code I''ve written in the past for personal projects, or more terrifyingly, any one of my internships. Was all that Javascript I frantically hammered out last Summer at Puppet Labs really written at a level that could be considered "professional"?<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis question led me to scouring the internet to find out just what real software developers consider to be "good" programming. Answer after answer on StackOverflow presented me with some pretty foreign looking stuff, often in languages I''m not familiar with. It''s not easy to pick up on clean technique when you aren''t already very comfortable with the language.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter much searching and agonizing over how dirty and horrible my code could have been, I finally found <i>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</i> by Robert Martin. Three chapters in, and I can safely say that my past coding structure and organization was, indeed, rather bad!<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe good news is that this book is an excellent resource for learning how to overcome bad coding habits, and start getting your work to a level acceptable for submission to a professional software team. Martin''s writing style is very descriptive and accessible, making it easy to follow along with his justifications for picking up certain habits, or leaving bad ones behind. Be warned, however, that his examples are written in Java, so it may be a good idea to brush up on the language to get the most out of them<br>.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThus far, I''d say that the book has definitely helped me to elevate some of my coding fundamentals. The first chapter, for example, focuses on the creation of meaningful names. On the surface, this sounds like a trivially easy, day-one subject for any new programmer. In reality, the lacking of proper naming skills is an affliction affecting even professional developers! There is more to it than you might think, and there''s a lot to be gained from Martin''s advice.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis, along with the many other subjects of the book are excellent for reevaluating the programming skills you think you already know and taking them to the next level. I wanted to feel as if I could join a team of developers and actively contribute solid code, and with this book I feel as if I''ve been set in the right direction at a good pace.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs a last aside, it''s worth noting that <i>Clean Code</i> is not a text that will help you learn new algorithms or design patterns. These are things which you''ll probably want to come in with some knowledge of to get the most out of Martin''s work. All in all, however, Clean Code is an excellent read that anyone looking to enhance their coding fundamentals should pick up. Not only is it a very effective guide, but it is also a whole lot of fun to read, and results are nearly instant with some practice!
