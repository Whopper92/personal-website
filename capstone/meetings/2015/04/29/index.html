<h4>Notes</h4>
<pre class='prettyprint'>

    * Make cool top bar thing for presentation
    * Look into animation to slide bar up to rop
    * Top bar gray out 

  * O'Connor: Inventory (Carly to follow up)
    + Full stack
    + Little bit of hardware (optional)
      o Barcodes provided
    + High use, practical
    + Work environment fits our agile workflow well
    + Open-endedness
    + Carly has experience in this area
    - Worried that he might not have a workflow to base our software around
      + Realistic

  * Conway 1: Log analysis
    + Working with company
    + Cool concept
    + Better than Sanders
    + Pretty neutral
    - Reimplement existing things
    - Not a lot of development - more configuration
    - No promises for data, kinda sketchy
    - Not useful or needed
    - No scope

  * Conway 2: System health dashboard (Joel - this + time card)
    + Working with company
    + Open ended - we could go crazy
    + Mobile component
    + User interface - we like
    + Tech stack is good
    - Didn;t list all the system that we'd be monitoring
    - Lots of legacy apps
    - Lots of existing things
    - Might be hard to get access to servers to monitor

  * Conway 3: Time card webapp
    - Really easy
    + Could app mobile components if needed
    - He was not enthusiastic about this one
    - No idea about Kronos

  * Clark & Greg: Gerrit frontend (Will)
    + Challenge
    + Very visible, used by lots + Openstack
    + Open webapp
    - Would have to use Gerrit
      - Might have to figure out where code is hosted
    - All webwork, JS, not a lot of tech variety
    + Easily split up work
    - They were against anything non-JS (elm)

  * Wayne Haythorne: Android Timekeeping app (Luke)
    - Strange sponsor
    + Idea is fine, no unified implementation for Android
    + Mobile tech
    + If we could get endorsement, could be exciting
    - He wanted a lot of control "no I don't like it" etc
    + Flexible in some ways
    + Works with our iterations
    + Realistic customer
    - He had not google'd his own project
    ? Figure out IP: who owns published project?
      + Realistic monetization

  * Ursina Teuscher + Dan: Real estate app (Jason)
    + Wide tech stack
      + Front end and back end
    - The backend is already figured out
      - Glorified version of existing thing
    + Database work
    + Clear requirements
    + Fits well with our agile flow
    + Realistic app, going to be used
    - Doesn't want to do open source, maybe? Licensing issues
      ? We need to figure out how IP works with this one
      ? Can we do open source version with mock data

  * Dan: ViceKeeper retirement saving app
