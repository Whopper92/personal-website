<h2>Team Meeting 3: April 22nd, 2015</h2>

<h4>Agenda</h4>

<pre>
  * Sponsor presentations! (30 mins)
    - Discussion - What do we like / dislike about each:
      * S-Store MIMIC by Tufte
      * Firefox OS by Mozilla
      * Corporate Carpooling by NAVEX Global
      * eLearning Platform in Accessbility by Dr. Sam Sennott
      * Curated Docker by Brandon Sanders
      * Simultaneous WikiMedia by Brandon Sanders
      * Facebook Reputation by Brandon Sanders

    - Following up: let's email the sponsors of the projects we might like (10 mins)

      o Tufte:
        - Where should the code live while being developed, and where will it end up?
        - Most big points covered in her presentation, but see general questions below.
      o NAVEX:
        - They mentioned stakeholders in HR - would we be getting feedback from HR,
          and how often?
        - They mentioned the carpool data should be "secure." Specific guidelines?
        - Clarify about the specifically-for-NAVEX bit. Are they okay with the app being
          built for multiple orgs but customizable off the bat?
      o eLearning:
        - Can we find some aspect of this huge plan to grab on to and shape into
          a manageable project?
      o All:
        - What would their average weekly schedule look like for meeting with us?
        - How often would they be available to meet? Weekly? In person? Remote?
          o Are they available for quick questions via Email, chat, etc?
        - Frequency of project demos?
        - Where should development take place? Our (PSU) servers or sponsor servers?

  * Our presentation (15 mins)
    - Platform: Google Docs? Something else?
    - What we will need: 
      o 6 top choices, bottom 3 choices
      o Explain why we arranged them that way and how we chose our favorites
      o Explain the relative strength of our preferences
      o We could:
        - Have a few slides dedicated to each top choice, one person describing why we like
          it
        - Have one or two slides describing why we don't want our bottom 3, if necessary

  (Remaining time)
  * Additional items
    - Will and Max need to figure out a time to work on Git workshop

  * Anything else? Thoughts, questions, concerns?

  * Action items: one team member responsible for following up with each sponsor we're
    interested in.
      - Send email by Friday
